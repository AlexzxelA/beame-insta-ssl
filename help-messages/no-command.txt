Usage:

	beame-insta-ssl create BIG_TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL
	beame-insta-ssl list
	beame-insta-ssl tunnel [ DESTINATION_HOST: ]DESTINATION_PORT DESTINATION_PROTO [--hostname <HOSTNAME>] [--fqdn FQDN]
	beame-insta-ssl export <fqdn> <destination_folder>


	beame-insta-ssl create BIG_TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL

		Creates 'SOMETHING.beameio.net' certificate.

	beame-insta-ssl list

		Lists certificates

	beame-insta-ssl tunnel [DESTINATION_HOST:]DESTINATION_PORT DESTINATION_PROTO [--hostname <HOSTNAME>] [--fqdn FQDN]

		Creates tunnel from https://SOMETHING.beameio.net to the
		specified destination.

		If DESTINATION_PROTO is "http", the tunnel will terminate TLS
		traffic and transform the requests to HTTP. This way you can
		run existing HTTP server unmodifed.

		Examples:
			beame-insta-ssl tunnel 8080 http
			beame-insta-ssl tunnel 192.168.0.200:8443 https --hostname web200.localdomain

		[ DESTINATION_HOST: ]   - your end of the tunnel, defaults to localhost
		DESTINATION_PORT        - your end of the tunnel
		DESTINATION_PROTO       - protocol to use on your end of the tunnel ("http" or "https")
		[--hostname <HOSTNAME>] - The "Host:" header to set in incoming requests (terminating tunnel only)
		[--fqdn FQDN]           - The FQDN to use for the remote end of the tunnel. If you only have one,
		                          which should be the usual case, you don't need to specify the FQDN.

	beame-insta-ssl export <FQDN> <DESTINATION_FOLDER>

		FQDN               - the FQDN of the certificate to export
		DESTINATION_FOLDER - the folder to export the certificate to. The folder must exist.
		                     The export operation will place 'FQDN.*' files in the folder.
		                     No files will be overwritten. Please make sure you have restrictive
		                     permissions for that folder. Current version of beame-insta-ssl
							 does not handle resulting files' permissions.
